# Algorithm ReadMe

> Embarking on a New Journey

This article, which has been in the making for over two months(starts: 1699498740176), signifies a pivotal moment for me. However, uncertainty looms over its completion, primarily due to a lack of persistence.

# New Journey

> Sharing My Algorithmic Expedition

## What Are Algorithms?

The fundamental question to address is: What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a defined set of steps that one must follow to solve a problem. There exist various types of algorithms, each tailored to specific problem-solving scenarios. Thus, selecting the appropriate algorithm and mastering the art of algorithmic learning are key considerations.

## How to Learn Algorithms?

Multiple avenues facilitate the learning of algorithms, with several reputable books dedicated to the subject.

In this blog, I intend to document algorithms I have recently acquired knowledge about, offering insights into my ongoing journey of algorithmic exploration. The content encompasses:

- My approach to learning algorithms.
- Lessons gleaned from algorithmic endeavors.
- Aspirations for future learning.
- Encountered challenges and their resolutions.
- Problem-solving methodologies.
- Techniques for learning and applying algorithms.
- Strategies for algorithmic improvement.
- Classification and types of algorithms.
- Fundamental principles of algorithms.
- Distinguishing between algorithms and programming.
- Integrating algorithms into programming and interview scenarios.
- Reflecting on encountered issues and resolutions.

## What's Next?

> I aim to articulate the algorithmic journey clearly and succinctly, inviting collaboration for improvement.

## End of it

> While uncertainty shrouds the completion of this article, one certainty prevails—I am committed to refining it continuously!

All articles will initially be written in English and may later be translated into Chinese.
