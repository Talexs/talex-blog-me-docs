# Be a beginner

## Introduction

Actually, I've been practiced in coding for a long time, and myself is a good coder.
But, long time boring coding in one area, I want to try something new.

This, is my first attempt to try something new.

## What I want to do

Today, this article written to show my development process.
And, it will be a strict teacher to me.

## What I've done

This article is written many by me and be prettied by auto-completion.

> AND HERE ARE MY GOALS TO REACH IT BEFORE MY 19th BIRTHDAY.

- Learn at least one another language.

My goal is to learn `Golang` and I have been work on it for many times. Will, I prepared for it.

- Practice my English writing skills.

Many times ago, I always write in Chinese and English, but always using auto-completion.

Now, I will try my best to write in English for at least one essay or more per month.

- Complete 100 Algorithms in LeetCode.

This is the last challenge and it will greatly be a good experience.

I never thought this is simply but it worth doing.

Besides, I'd like to program an newer `MARKDOWN EDITOR` than ever instead of continuously developing my `talex-touch` and using `VS-Code`

Because of others are not satisfied for my own personal reasons.

By the way: I'm learning to play piano and I've bought a new piano. It's really nice.

AND, in this year **JUNE**, I'm going to the concert of **Gloria** in ChengDu. HOPE EVERYTHING GOES WELL.

## Conclusion

Today is 2024/02/08, I'm going to fill my challenges step by step.

Hope I will soon finish all of them.

> I'm going to write more articles like this.

The goal challenges will be updated in the future.

Setting up these greatly help me to keep myself motivated.

HOPE IT WORKS! SEE YOU THEN!
